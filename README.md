# Photos from the Great Beyond
Photos from the Great Beyond (PGB) is an interactive website to allow you to see photos of the day from NASA and also the mars rover images.

# Development
In order to implement this project, we created a backend using a MongoDB database, Express.js, Node.JS and Mongoose. Below is a chart showing the flow of data through our process:

# Improvements
We would like to implement pagination into express.js in order to optimize time and space complexity of our frontend. 
Currently it takes to much time to load all the information sent out from the backend to the front end when used on a 
low end mobile connection.
